# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Kickstarter data analyzed and visualized by countries, dates, and categories. 

Regarding a launch date, I recommend starting in May. Most successful campaigns start in May but success rates immediately start to dip in consecutive months.

Regarding your fundraising goal, in the US, successful plays had average goals around $3,000-$5,000 were successful; whereas those with goals of  $5,000-$10,000 failed. 

Regarding your interest in Musicals in Great Britain, I’ve compiled that data. Most of them had a goal of $1,000-$2,000, with the exception of “The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Family” which had a goal of $4,000. Most of their pledges were close to the goal but not much over.
